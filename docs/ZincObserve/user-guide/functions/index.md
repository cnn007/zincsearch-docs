# Functions

## What are functions?

Functions in ZincObserve are defined using [lua script](https://www.lua.org/) & can used during ingestion & query to aid advanced capabilities like enrichment, redaction, log reduction, compliance, etc. 

Based on function applicability , functions can be categorized as :

1. Ingest time function
1. Query function

** Ingest time function ** : This type of function is applicable during ingestion for a specific stream.

** Query function ** : This type of function is applicable to queries , doesn't need stream to be specified while defining function. This kind of function can be used for all the streams belonging one's organization.

There are also inbuilt query functions like match_all , match_all_no_case which can be used for full text search based on users settings for stream or default settings.

To navigate to functions in ZincObserve , select preferred organization using organization selection control, then click on ![Functions](../../images/functions.jpg) menu , which will take one to  functions list screen. The screen lists all (ingest time & query type) the functions for selected organization.
