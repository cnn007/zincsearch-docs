# Welcome to ZincSearch


## Why ZincSearch

ZincSearch was started since there was no search engine that was available that could serve my needs.

While Elasticsearch is a very good product, it is complex and requires lots of resources and is more than a decade old. I built ZincSearch so it becomes easier for folks to use full text search indexing without doing a lot of work.
